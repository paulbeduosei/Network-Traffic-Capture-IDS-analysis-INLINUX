# Network-Traffic-Capture-IDS-analysis-INLINUX
I used Suricata to run IDS/alerting on a packet capture, reviewed generated logs and alerts, and parsed the JSON output to extract key fields. The work included creating a custom rule, running Suricata against a pcap, reviewing the produced logs in /var/log/suricata, and attempting to filter records with jq.
